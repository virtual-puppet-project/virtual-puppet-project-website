## VPupPr hiatus

The main developer of vpuppr ([@Youwin](https://github.com/you-win)) has decided to take an official hiatus! Community forks of vpuppr may exist in the future for both godot versions (3.x and 4.x) so keep an eye out.

## I read the docs but still need help!

Come join the [Discussion](https://github.com/virtual-puppet-project/vpuppr/discussions)! The community can help you in real-time!

## What is vpuppr?

vpuppr is an open-source project that animates models using the `glb` and `vrm` file formats.
It is most notable for tracking and rendering 3D Vtuber models.

## What are the supported platforms?

vpuppr is currently supported on Windows and most common Linux distributions. OSX is not currently supported, however packaging vpuppr should be doable by following the [official Godot instructions](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_macos.html).

## How do I report an issue?

Issues should be submitted on [GitHub](https://github.com/virtual-puppet-project/vpuppr/issues). Be sure to include your operating system, app version, logs, and any other related information.

## How do I build from source?

vpuppr runs off a custom build of the Godot engine. Get a pre-compiled build of the engine [here](https://github.com/you-win/godot/releases). After that, follow the official vpuppr instructions [here](https://github.com/virtual-puppet-project/vpuppr#building-from-source).

## Why is tracking is not responding?

Please note it might take a second for tracking to activate. It _is_ trying to track your face! Also check that your face is well lit. Usually having a lamp above your desk is enough. If it's still not working, submit an issue and/or ask the Discussion board!

## Why is mouse tracking not included by default?

Simply put, it's a very niche use-case and is less preferable to real face tracking.

## What engine is vpuppr using?

Currently vpuppr stable runs on Godot 3.x with 4.x in development but on hiatus for now.
